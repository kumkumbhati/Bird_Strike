# Bird Strikes Data Visualization (2000 â€“ 2011)
This project visualizes bird strike data from 2000 to 2011 to identify patterns and trends in<br>
aviation safety. The dataset includes details on aircraft type, airport name, altitude, number <br>
of wildlife struck, impact on flight, flight date, damage caused, airline/operator, phase of flight,<br>
weather conditions, and cost incurred. To run the project, install the required libraries (pandas,<br>
matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter), clone the repository, and run the Bird_Strikes.ipynb notebook.<br>
Visualizations include bird strikes per year, top 10 airlines, top 50 airports, yearly cost of <br>
bird strikes, and bird strikes by phase of flight
