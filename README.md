#Bird Strikes Data Visualization (2000 â€“ 2011)
This project visualizes bird strike data from 2000 to 2011 to identify patterns and trends in aviation safety.<br> 
The dataset includes details on aircraft type, airport name, altitude, number of wildlife struck, impact on flight, flight date, damage caused, airline/operator, <br>
phase of flight, weather conditions, and cost incurred. To run the project, install the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter), clone the repository,<br> 
and run the Bird_Strikes.ipynb notebook. Visualizations include bird strikes per year, top 10 airlines, top 50 airports, yearly cost of bird strikes, and bird strikes<br> 
by phase of flight.<br> 
Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
